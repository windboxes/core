# Wind Boxes Core

React Package is moved to `@windboxes/react`

## Introduction
Wind Boxes is a tool for create tailwind & css modules components.

You also can inject new class into css modules file.

You can use **array**, **string** and **sx prop** to change style and create a component.

## React
This package only support React now

I'm trying support other framework for windboxes.

Now you can try [`@windboxes/react`](https://github.com/windboxes/core/tree/main/packages/react)
